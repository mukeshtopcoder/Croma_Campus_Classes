Python Operators
a+b    =>    a,b (Operands) ,   +(Operator)
operator operates on operands

1- Arithmetic Operator
    + - * / // % **

a = 7
b = 5
print( a+b )
print( a-b )
print( a*b )
print( a/b )
print( a%b )    # % modulus (use to calculate the remainder)
print( 11%4 )
print( a//b )   # // floor division/truncation (remove point values from result)
print( 5//2 )
print( 5**3 )   # ** Exponential (use to calculate power of a number 5**3 => 5*5*5)
print( 2**4 )


2- Assignment Operator
    =    += , -= , *= etc (u can use with every arithmetic operator)

a = 10
a += 1      # a = a+1
a *= 2      # a = a*2
print( a )


3- Relational Operators  (Return Boolean value True/False)
    >  <  >=  <=  ==  !=

a = 7
b = 5
print( a>b )
print( a<b )  
print( a>=b )
print( a<=b )
print( a!=b )    #   !=    is not equal to
print( a==b )    #   ==    is equal to

4- Membership Operator    ( Return Boolean Answer )
    in , not in    ( Check Existance )

a = "amankumar"
b = 'aman'
print( b in a )
print( "mohan" in a )
print( "ankum" in a )
print( "k" in a )
print( "z" in a )
print( "ka" in a )
print( "ka" not in a )
print( "aman" not in a )

5- Identity Operator
