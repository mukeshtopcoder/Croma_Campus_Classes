WAP to add two numbers?

a = 10
b = 20
c = a+b
print(c)


a = 10
print('a')
print("a")          # it will print a as it is
print(a)            # it will print value of a


a = 10
b = 20
c = a+b
print("Addition :",c)


Built-in Functions
print , input (is use to ask value from a user),
int (integer) it will convert text to number

a = int( input("Enter A Number : ") )
b = int( input("Enter B Number : ") )
c = a+b
print('Addition :',c)

float  (it will convert text to number supports point values)

a = float( input("Enter A Number : ") )
b = float( input("Enter B Number : ") )
c = a+b
print('Addition :',c)


WAP to calculate the gross salary of an employee where
HRA is 20% and DA is 30% of his basic salary.
HINT:-  Gross_Salary = Basic_Salary + HRA + DA


bs = float( input("Enter Employee's Basic Salary : ") )
hra = bs*0.20
print("HRA :",hra)
da = bs*0.30
print("DA :",da)
gs = bs+hra+da
print("Gross Salary :",gs)

bs = float( input("Enter Employee's Basic Salary : ") )
hra = bs*0.20
da = bs*0.30
gs = bs+hra+da
print("Gross Salary :",gs)


WAP to calculate the area of a rectangle and perimeter.
HINT:- Area = Height * Width
HINT:- perimeter = 2*(height+width)

h = int( input("Enter Hight of the Rectangle : ") ) 
w = int( input("Enter Width of the Rectangle : ") )
area = h*w
peri = 2*(h+w)
print("Area :",area)
print("Perimeter :",peri)
